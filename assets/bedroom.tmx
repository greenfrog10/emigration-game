    <property name="text">He learned French very quickly through cartoons and reading books.
He became so proficient that he eventually no longer fit in with
his classmates, who disliked his advanced vocabulary and overly
formal way of speaking. One reason he learned French so fast is
that he was forbidden from speaking Tamil (his mother tongue)
by our parents. This was very traumatic for him and caused him
to lose much of his ability to use Tamil properly. Today, he can
still understand and speak it to some extent, but he can no longer
read or write it. He still regrets it to this day.

    <property name="text">One of the main things that helped him and I preserve our
connection to Tamil culture was Tamil cinema. This film
industry is very unique and should not be confused with
Bollywood. In India, each region has its own film industry,
stars, iconic movies, standards, and culture. Bollywood is
often incorrectly referred to as Indian cinema, but it only
represents one part of the country. The region where we
come from, Tamil Nadu, has its own film industry called
Kollywood. He watched many of these movies (often through
sketchy websites) and still listens to their music today
with me. These films and songs have helped him and I stay
connected to Tamil culture.</property>
